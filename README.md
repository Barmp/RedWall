# RedWall
RedWall (Reddit Wallpapers) was created to download pictures from subreddit frontpages.


### Good to know:
- Only downloads pictures with direct image links

  UPDATE: reddit is worse and worse since the script was originally created in case of direct links... The lack of user behavior
  (link post does not target images directly) makes this script pretty much worthless now :(
- Valid image resolution is added to the filenames of the downloaded images, like "[1920x1080] Art.jpg" to ease manual selection later
- NSFW subreddits will not work
- According to feedbacks: script will not work properly if proxy is used. I could not test and solve it.

### Usage:
- Before run: modify the source code for your need (manually in the PERSONALIZATION section)
- It is recommended to create a daily scheduled task calling the script
