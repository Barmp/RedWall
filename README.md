# RedWall
RedWall (Reddit Wallpapers) was created to download pictures from subreddit frontpages.

### Good to know:
- Only downloads pictures with direct image links
- Valid image resolution is added to the filenames of the downloaded images, like "[1920x1080] Art.jpg" to ease manual selection later
- NSFW subreddits will not work
- According to feedbacks: script will not work properly if proxy is used. I could not test and solve it.


### Usage:
- Before run: modify the source code for your need (manually in the PERSONALIZATION section)
- It is recommended to create a daily scheduled task calling the script
